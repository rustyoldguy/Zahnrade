# Zahnrade

A little program to calculate the values of gears like pitch diameter, outer diameter, root circle Module or modulus, m
number of teeth.

History:
In december 2007 i had an accident at work(milling machine). Later i got a infection at my left hand with Methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Later 13 operations in a hostpital to save my left hand(flap plastic). You can see a picture
of my left hand after 12th operation. After this i needed to change my job. I got a retraining to a skilled worker for quality
assurance. After retraining during unemployed time i wrote this program to help ohter People in retraining to learn.


This are the modulus( in mm) where are currently included:
0.3, 0.7, 1.25, 2.25, 3.25, 4.5, 6.5, 10, 14, 20, 30, 42, 60,
0.4, 0.8, 1.5,  2.5,  3.5,  5,   7,   11, 15, 22, 33, 45, 65,
0.5, 0.9, 1.75, 2.75, 3.75, 5.5, 8,   12, 16, 24, 36, 50, 70,
0.6, 1,   2,    3,    4,    6,   9,   13, 18, 27, 39, 55, 75

Sorry, it is written in german. I hope that anybody can translate the program in to english

occurance for name of this source:
I prefer to add a letter from a to z to mark the different versions of the source(workspace)
Zahnrade = Zahnrad version of workspace e
The source is created at SUSE LINUX tumbleweed with codelite IDE 15.0.0

Also included is to calculate the number of teeth to measure up with plate micrometer
and values for gear tooth caliper.

Just see and try it, so you can give me tips to make this program better.

I hope you have success to create the program with this soure and
much success to work with it

Thanks for your attention
